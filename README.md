# AeroData Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes aerospace-related data with the goal of uncovering patterns, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models.  
The notebook `AeroData_FullyAnnotated.ipynb` contains the complete workflow with explanations, inline comments, and future improvement suggestions.

## Contents
- **AeroData_FullyAnnotated.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code, markdown explanations, and insights.
- **Raw Dataset**: Data file used for analysis (not included in repo, ensure correct path is set in the notebook).
- **Outputs**: Any visualizations, model performance metrics, and predictions generated during execution.

## Workflow
1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the dataset and objectives of the analysis.
2. **Data Loading**
   - Importing necessary Python libraries.
   - Reading data from CSV/Excel sources.
   - Inspecting data structure using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and incorrect data types.
   - Feature selection or engineering where applicable.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Identifying distributions, correlations, and outliers.
5. **Modeling**
   - Training machine learning models.
   - Evaluating performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE.
6. **Results & Insights**
   - Key findings supported by visualizations and model outputs.
7. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of results and learnings.
8. **Future Improvements**
   - Improve preprocessing with scaling/normalization.
   - Use more advanced models (e.g., ensemble learning, deep learning).
   - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Automating report generation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Place the dataset file in the appropriate directory (update path in the notebook if needed).
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook AeroData_FullyAnnotated.ipynb
   ```
4. Run cells step by step to reproduce the analysis.
